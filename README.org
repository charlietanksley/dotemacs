* Dotemacs

Here is my emacs configuration.  It isn't really intended for public
consumption, though obviously anyone is free to do anything they want
with it.

** Usage

I'm using [[http://cask.github.io][Cask]] to manage my packages as far as possible.  So to get
everything up and running here you should:

1. Install Cask (see link above).
2. Within your =.emacs.d= directory, run =cask install=.

That should be it for now.  Note that I've split this off from the
rest of my dotfiles and am experimenting with slowly migrating to [[http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU
Stow]] for my dotfile management. To install, do =stow emacs= from within this directory.
